# Introduction to travelFocusApp

A fullstack application written in React that allows a single place to be added to a list to visit after logging in. The place, which includes a photo, can be fully edited or deleted. In addition, the application has implemented Google maps with location, so we are able to quickly see where we are. Each place can be set to be visible to the public or as a private place. It is also possible to deselect to a completed list and, once added to a list, the card is automatically updated. The user has the option to delete or edit the profile, including the avatar. Express.js was used as the backend, the data is stored in MongoDb and the images are hosted in AWS S3. Form validation is both on the frontend and on the server side. It uses a token for authentication, which is stored in localStorage.
